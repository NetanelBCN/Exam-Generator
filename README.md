Welcome to our Exam Generator !!! 

Please read the instructions below regarding part 2 of our project!

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.The interface that was needed to be added is called "MenuFunctions", it is not connected with the main as it causes errors with the static methods.

2.All files regarding the program are in the folder called: "Test_Files", make sure to check it while using the program.

3.The memory of the program is stored in a binary file called "db_File", do not delete this file! also make sure not to terminate the
program and only close it using the number '0', as the menu suggests, terminating will cause the binary file to be deleted!

4.In case the binary file was deleted and you need it back, there is a backup of it called "db_File.backup", delete the ".backup" in order to use it.

5.Text files of the exams and solutions are also stored in the "Test_Files" folder, we added a counter to the name format, allowing you to add as many exams as you wish.
In addition, all copies of existing exams have their own name format wich also indicates which exam was copied.

6.All exams are now sorted using the new sort and not the old one as requested in the project instructions.

Enjoy your testing! :)
